# Reactive Pattern in Angular with Stateful Services

The reactive pattern in Angular involves using stateful services to manage application state, instead of keeping state in components. This pattern leverages RxJS Observables to create a "store" that components can subscribe to.

## Implementation in Angular

In Angular, we can implement the reactive pattern by creating a service that acts as the store. This service will handle all state operations and encapsulate the logic to manage state.

## Benefits

The reactive pattern with stateful services provides several benefits:

- **Decoupling**: By keeping state in services instead of components, we decouple our components from the state management logic. This makes our components more focused on presenting data and handling user interactions.
- **Reusability**: Stateful services can be injected into any component, making it easy to share and sync state across different parts of the application.
- **Reactivity**: By using Observables, we can leverage the power of RxJS to transform, combine, and react to changes in our state in a declarative way.
